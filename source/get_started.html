<p>
Here are the basic steps to getting a development copy of tpkg up and running.
Once you're ready to progress to a production-grade install see our
<a href="production.html">production setup</a> page.
</p>

<h2>Client</h2>

<h3>Via RubyGems</h3>
<p>
Our recommended installation process is via RubyGems:
</p>
<p>
<tt>gem install tpkg</tt>
</p>

<h3>MacPorts</h3>
<p>
On a Mac the MacPorts system provides an alternative easy installation:
</p>
<p>
<tt>port install tpkg</tt>
</p>

<h3>The Hard Way</h3>
<p>
If you'd prefer, you can download the tpkg source tarball and run from there.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/tpkg/client/downloads">Download tpkg</a> and unpack it.
</p>
<p>
If you add the client directory to your PATH you can run tpkg without
installing it. Since you're running the client without building and installing
the client package you'll have to resolve dependencies manually for now. The
client depends on the
<a href="http://www.reductivelabs.com/projects/facter/">facter</a> library.
This
<a href="http://reductivelabs.com/trac/puppet/wiki/DownloadingPuppet">page</a>
has links to facter packages for a variety of platforms. If you have Ruby Gems
you can install facter with <tt>gem install facter</tt>.
</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>
Tpkg will use /opt/tpkg as the base directory by default, which is where it
will install relocatable packages and store its own state. If you want to test
out tpkg without root privileges you can create ~/.tpkg.conf:
</p>

<pre>
base = /home/you/tpkgbase</pre>

<h2 id="DemoPackage">Demo Package</h2>

<p>
Here are some instructions for making up a quick package and installing it.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>mkdir /tmp/demopkg</tt></li>
  <li>Create /tmp/demopkg/tpkg.yml:
<pre>name: demopkg
version: 1.0
maintainer: Nobody
description: Some description</pre></li>
  <li><tt>mkdir /tmp/demopkg/reloc</tt></li>
  <li><tt>touch /tmp/demopkg/reloc/demofile</tt></li>
  <li><tt>tpkg --make /tmp/demopkg</tt></li>
  <li><tt>tpkg --install /tmp/demopkg-1.0.tpkg</tt></li>
  <li><tt>rm -rf /tmp/demopkg /tmp/demopkg-1.0.tpkg</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>
The install should have created /home/you/tpkgbase/demofile.
<tt>tpkg --qa</tt> should list the package as installed,
<tt>tpkg --ql demopkg</tt> should list the files in the package, etc.
Experiment with more complex packages, check out the
<a href="package.html">packaging documentation</a> page for more info, or
consult the pkgs directory in the distribution for scripts which build
complete packages of common applications like Perl, Ruby, etc.
</p>

<p>
To see what other tpkg operations are available, please consult the man page
or use the tpkg -h command.
