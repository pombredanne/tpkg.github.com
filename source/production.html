<h2>Package Repository</h2>

<p>
Set up a <a href="package_server.html">package server</a>.  If you have more
than one colo/datacenter/server room set up a duplicate package server in one
of the secondary locations and rsync the repository to the secondary server
regularly. This allows you to continue to perform deployments in the event
that you lose the primary datacenter. 
</p>

<p>
If you've set up the reporting server then packages can be uploaded via
<a href="http://tpkg/uploads/new">http://tpkg/uploads/new</a>.  The directory
where uploaded packages will be saved can be configured via the "upload_path"
parameter of the <a href="reporting_server.html">reporting server</a>'s
configuration file.
