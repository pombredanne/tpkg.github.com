<p>
The deployment feature of tpkg allows you to perform a variety of
tpkg operations on a list of machines. This is done by running tpkg
with the --servers or -s flag, follows by a comma-separated list of
machines that you want to perform the operations on. Please note
that this need to be executed from a machine that can ssh to all of
the machines in your list of targets.
</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<p>
To install package "foo":
<pre>tpkg -i foo -s server1,server2,server3</pre>
This assumes that the package has already been uploaded to the repo.
See the
<a href="package_server.html">package server documentation</a> for
information on how to set up your repo, and see the
<a href="configuration.html">configuration documentation</a> for
information on how to point tpkg to a particular repo.
</p>

<p>
To install a package from a URL:
<pre>tpkg -i http://example.com/repository/foo.tpkg -s server1,server2,server3</pre>
</p>

<p>
To remove package:
<pre>tpkg -r foo -s server1,server2,server3</pre>
</p>

<p>
To start a package init script:
<pre>tpkg --start foo -s server1,server2,server3</pre>
</p>

<p>
To see what packages are installed:
<pre>tpkg --qa -s server1,server2,server3</pre>
</p>

<p>
If you want to deploy the packages as a user that is different from the login user:
<pre>--deploy-as username</pre>
</p>

<p>
For automation purposes, you can set up an ssh key, and tell tpkg to use it
via the following option.  Note that tpkg may still need to prompt you for a
sudo password.
<pre>--use-ssh-key</pre>
</p>
