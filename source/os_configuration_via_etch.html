<p>
This page documents how one site uses the tpkg externals feature in
conjunction with <a href="http://etch.sourceforge.net/">etch</a>.
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The tpkg for an application should encapsulate all files and configuration
needed for the application to run on top of a generic base system in our
environment. As such there is a mechanism for a tpkg to request custom OS
configuration from our OS configuration management system
<a href="http://etch.sourceforge.net/">Etch</a>. This is done through the
"externals" section in tpkg.yml. Entries in "externals" trigger tpkg to call
pre-defined external scripts that we provide, which in our case register
requests with etch for the desired configuration and then run etch to activate
that configuration. When a package is removed the external script is run to
remove the request and run etch to deactivate the configuration.
</p>

<p>
The general format of the externals section is:
</p>

<pre>externals:
  - name: user
    data: myuser
  - name: nfs
    datafile: nfsmountsfile
  - name: sysctl
    datascript: ./calculate_kernel_memory_settings</pre>
    
<p>
The name field specifies the name of the external to call (see below for valid
options). The data to pass to the external can either be specified inline via
the "data" field, in an external file referenced via the "datafile" field, or
an external script referenced via the "datascript" field. The script for
datascript can be any form of valid executable, it should be contained in your
package directory structure, and referenced with a path relative to the top of
the package directory structure (i.e. the directory where tpkg.yml lives).
Whatever your datascript script outputs will be fed to the tpkg external
script. We envision this being particularly useful in calculating kernel
parameters based on things like the amount of physical memory in a system.
</p>

<h2>Supported Externals</h2>

<h3>User</h3>
<pre>
  externals:
  - name: user
    data: myuser
  - name: user
    group:mygroup</pre>
    
<p>
Requests that etch add the specified user to /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow. The
user must already exist in our database, either as a human or as an
application account defined though the SingleSignOn system. If the request is
for group:mygroup then all members of the mygroup group will be added.
Requests for groups and human users will only be honored on non-production
systems.
</p>

<h3>Group</h3>

<pre>
  externals:
  - name: group
    data: mygroup</pre>

<p>
Requests that etch add the specified group to /etc/group. This is currently a
no-op in our environment as etch always adds all groups to all systems.
However, feel free to include this in your package as documentation that your
package requires a particular group, and on the off chance that the etch
behavior changes at some point in the future (highly unlikely).
</p>

<h3>Sudo</h3>

<pre>
  externals:
  - name: sudo   
    data: myuser
  - name: sudo
    data: group:mygroup</pre>

<p>
Requests that etch give the specified user sudo privileges. You should
probably also have a user external to add the user's account. If the request
is for group:mygroup then all members of the mygroup group will be given
privileges. Requests for sudo privileges will only be honored on non-production systems.
</p>

<h3>NFS</h3>

<pre>
  externals:
  - name: nfs
    data: mymount nfsserver:/path/to/mount
</pre>

<p>
Adds the specified entry to /etc/auto.auto, thus creating an automount point
under /auto. This is our standard location for NFS mounts. The entry is added
to /etc/auto.auto as is, so any valid automount options and syntax can be
specified.
</p>

<h3>Sysctl</h3>

<pre>
  externals:
  - name: sysctl
    data: kernel.bogus = 0</pre>

<p>
Adds the specified entry to /etc/sysctl.conf, used for setting kernel parameters.
</p>

<h3>IPtables</h3>

<pre>
  externals:
  - name: iptables
    data: 
&lt;filter&gt;
-A INPUT -m tcp -p tcp --dport ssh --syn -j ACCEPT
&lt;/filter&gt;
&lt;nat&gt;
-A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 4000
-A OUTPUT -o lo -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 4000
&lt;/nat&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Adds the specified entries to /etc/sysconfig/iptables, used for packet
filtering.  Entries within &lt;filter&gt; are added to the *filter section in
the config file.  This is the most common usage, these rules are used to
filter packets.  Entries within &lt;nat&gt; are added to the *nat section of
the config file.  This is not as frequently used, but can be used to redirect
packets from one port to another port and various forms of NAT and PAT.
</p>

<h3>Limits</h3>

<pre>
  externals:
  - name: limits
    data: myuser hard nofile 4096</pre>

<p>
Adds the specified entries to /etc/security/limits.conf, used for controlling
various per-user limits like number of open filehandles and number of processes.
</p>
