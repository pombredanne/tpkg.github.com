Here's an example crontab for use on systems that do not support
/etc/cron.d style crontabs.  The jobs will run as the user specified
in tpkg.yml.  If that happens to be root then you could use
su or sudo to run individual jobs as other users.  See the
<a href="packaging.html">packaging documentation</a> for more
details about incorporating a crontab into a package.

Consult your system's cron documentation for further details.  In particular note that Solaris and possibly other systems do not allow blank lines in crontabs.
