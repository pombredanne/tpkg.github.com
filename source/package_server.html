<p>
To create a tpkg repository you just need a directory of tpkgs and run
<tt>tpkg --extract /that/directory</tt>.  Then make that directory available
via any web server.  Re-run the <tt>tpkg --extract</tt> any time you add or
remove packages from the directory.
</p>

<p>
See the <a href="configure.html">configuration documentation</a> for info
about pointing clients at the URL for your repository.
</p>

<p>
<tt>tpkg --extract</tt> will create a metadata.yml file in the directory with
the metadata extracted from each package.
