<p>
tpkg looks at /etc/tpkg.conf and $HOME/.tpkg.conf for configuration settings.
Here are the possible configurations:
</p>

<pre>
  base              = /opt/tpkg
  source            = http://tpkg/tpkg
  source            = http://otherserver/tpkg
  report_server     = http://tpkg/client_update
  host_group_script = /home/me/tpkg_group_script
  sudo              = false
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt>base</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      This is where relocatable packages are installed, and where tpkg stores
      its state.  Defaults to /opt/tpkg if not specified in any of the config
      files.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>source</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      The package repository.  May be specified multiple times with different
      URLs if you have more than one repository.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>report_server</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    The URL for the <a href="reporting_server.html">reporting server</a>, if
    you've set it up.  If this is defined then all package
    install/upgrade/removal operations will be reported to the server.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>host_group_script</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      The filename for a script which takes one or more host group names as
      arguments and outputs the names of the hosts in those groups one per
      line on stdout.  Used with the --group option.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>sudo</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Should tpkg use sudo when performing package management operations?
      Defaults to yes.
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>
