  tpkg is a tool for packaging and deploying applications. It is designed to
  work alongside your operating system's packaging tool. The deployment
  features in tpkg are designed to scale to deployments across hundreds or
  thousands of systems.
</p>

<p>
  The packaging features of tpkg work in a similar fashion as many OS
  packaging tools like rpm, dpkg, SysV, etc, but with some additional
  features. Many shops just use the OS packaging system for their local
  applications, so why would you want to use a separate tool?
</p>

<ul>
  <li>tpkg is cross platform, so although you may have two or three different
    operating systems in your environment you can use a common tool to package
    and deploy your applications on those systems.</li>
  <li>Separating the packaging of applications from the base OS system ensures
    that application packages and their dependencies don't interfere with the
    functioning of the base OS. For example, your OS comes with Perl 5.6.1, but
    your application needs 5.8.9. By using tpkg and installing your application
    and the newer version of Perl in a isolated location you avoid any conflicts
    with base OS utilities that use the OS copy of Perl.</li>
  <li>tpkg supports encrypting some or all of the files in the package, so
    your application package can contain secret files like SSL or SSH keys,
    database passwords, etc.</li>
  <li>tpkg supports dependencies both on other tpkg packages as well as native
    packages, and tpkg handles dependency resolution and automatic dependency
    installation of both tpkg and native dependencies.</li>
  <li>tpkg supports external hooks that can be used to tie into a system
    configuration management tool, allowing packages to request accounts,
    NFS mounts, kernel settings, etc.</li>
  <li>Local caching of packages allows for rapid rollbacks.</li>
  <li>An optional ReportingServer allows you to see what packages are
    installed on systems in a central location.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The deployment features of tpkg allow you to automate the installation,
  upgrade or removal of packages across a large number of systems. Tpkg
  handles SSH and sudo prompts that might be encountered in connecting to the
  target systems. The parallelism of deployment operations can be adjusted so
  that deployments can be done in a rolling fashion at the desired rate.
